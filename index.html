    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <!-- Ill try to find a decent pic of myself, but most recent ones are with a groups of people,
    im not one to take many selfies, or many pics at all. I could use the one for work,
    but it makes my face look fat.-->

    <p1>
    I was born and raised in Athens, GA, and after high school I soon moved to 
    Atlanta to attend Georgia Tech. While I have always had an appreciation for 
    new technologies, I was at Tech when I built my first desktop and computers
    became a bigger hobby (and money pit). After graduating with a degree in business,
    I eventually got a job in Norcross working to price maintenance contracts for 
    enterprise hardware such as servers and networking devices. My experiance building
    my own computer helped me land the job, as servers are made up from the same general 
    components, and that helped speed up my learning curve. Four years later, 
    I decided I was bored enough in my work to try something new and GT Coding Boot Camp seemed
    like a good way to get a fresh start in an area of interest. While I have had decent knowledge
    of the hardware side of things, software is where the most growth and sustainability in 
    the work place is happening, and also seems like more fun.
    In my spare time I like walking my dog, watching NBA and NFL religiously, video games,
    and spending way too much time on my computer.
